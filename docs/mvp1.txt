Did MVP1 with
Redis, Nats, SqLite

Saved credentails to SqLite
Nats for Multiplexing of some sort.
Writing data to WAL and accessing.

Saved the complete data. 
Was able to export file completely. But, felt the data is big there.

Analysis:
Actually, we dont need that big of a data.
Each file was 300 mb at the end of the day and not able to analyse.
Mac gets vocal with the current approach.

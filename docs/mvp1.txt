Did MVP1 with
Redis, Nats, SqLite

Saved credentails to SqLite
Nats for Multiplexing of some sort.
Writing data to WAL and accessing.

Saved the complete data. 

Analysis:
Actually, we dont need that big of a data.
Each file was 300 mb at the end of the day and not able to analyse.
Mac gets vocal with the current approach.

For Go Application, Ensure the below stuff:
Best Practices
Use Channels for Communication: Prefer channels for communication and synchronization between goroutines.
Avoid Sharing Memory: Minimize the sharing of mutable data between goroutines.
Handle Errors: Properly handle errors in goroutines to prevent panics from crashing the entire program.
Use Context for Cancellation: Use the context package to propagate cancellation signals to goroutines.
Limit the Number of Goroutines: Avoid creating an excessive number of goroutines, as it can lead to performance degradation.
